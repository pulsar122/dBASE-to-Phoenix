General Public License (GPL), see the file COPYING for details.
The dbflib and the perl module are published under the GNU Library
General Public License (LGPL), see the file COPYING.lib for details.

freq.c, freq.h, dirlist.c are from the 'libsx' package and have their
own copyright. i've included them for people who have not the source
archive of the libsx library.

getopt.c, getopt.h are from the GNU libc, i needed them for compiling
hexdump under DOS.

HISTORIC
--------
On my old Linux box i had no flexible "hexdump", so i made my own one
(and cause of this historic reason this program is still included :)).
Next i want an X11-interface for my hexdump .. i wrote "xhex" based on
the SXlib (simple X). Some weeks later i needed the posibility to view
also in xBase files so the dbflib project was born :-)

SYSTEMS
-------
The following programs are written for Linux, but there should be no
problem to compile them on other systems. Binaries for Linux are in-
cluded (but not for the perl module) ..


PROGRAMS and the LIBRARY
========================

dbfconv, a2dbf and the other dbf* tools
---------------------------------------
Is just small programs to test my dbf routines.. you can use them
as examples .. 'dbfconv' e.g. could convert xbase files to ASCII,
LaTeX or HTML.

ATTENTION! the default behavior of dbfconv and xhex is to process
also deleted records! you can switch it off by command line argument.

WARNING: the dos version dbfconv.exe hangs while using the "-m"
switch :-( don't know why until now ..


libdbf.a
--------
Some routines to access xbase files, not very well programed because
i don't know about xbase and xbase files. Nevertheless reading should
work quite well :) i hope .. see dbf.3 for descriptions.
xbase III+ and IV should be supported .. (?) :-))

There is also an experimental DLL support for Win3.x included..
still not ready! I do not know enough about Win3.x and DLL :(

perl/
-----
The "perl/" directory contains an experimental perl module which
uses the dbflib C-library. This let's you access xBase files
with perl5.003 or higher. See also the README in this directory.

simple API
----------
libdbf.a is designed to have a simple API. to see this here is
a small but ready to run xbase converter:

#include <stdlib.h> /* free() */
#include "dbf.h"    /* dbOpen(), dbStrNext(), dbClose() */

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
	int db;
	UCHAR *s;

	if (argc > 1) {
		if ((db = dbOpen (argv[1], DB_READ)) > 0) {
			while ((s = dbStrNext(db, ';')) != NULL) {
				printf ("%s\n", s);
				free (s);
			}
			dbClose (db);
		}
	}
	return (0);
}

it's simple, isn't it? for a more complex converter see the
"dbfconv" program ..

hexdump
-------
This is my own version of hexdump, cause the included version
of Linux was not enough for me ..

xhex
----
Trying to play around with the Simple X Library i started to write
a X11 version from my hexdump program. It's very slow when reading
big files! xhex needs X11R5 or R6 and the Simple X Library. Linked
with libdbf.a or dbf.o xhex could also browse xbase files.

INSTALL
-------
edit lib/dbfP.h (LSB/MSB_HOST), edit the Makefile then say
 make endian.test
 make all
 make install

TODO
----
improvements for the libdbf, better documentions and bugfixes (?) ..
man-page for 'dbfconv', more output formats for 'dbfconv' ..
index-file support and complete memo-file support ..
support for "number of decimal places" for NUMBER fields

BUGS and PROBLEMS
-----------------
while converting a xbase file with \r or \n in a field it
gives not the wanted output (1 record per line).
workaround: use an other record seperator, e.g.
	dbfconv -r "@@@" test.dbf | perl -pne 's/\n/,/g; s/@@@/\n/g' > test.txt
or use the perl module ..

WARNING
-------
The API is still not ready, so check your source if you change
to a new version!

this_will_core_dump
-------------------
This file will core dump the xhex program while switching between
the differnt modes.. don't ask me why :)
