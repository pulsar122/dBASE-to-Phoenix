this is a perl module to link my dbf-library against perl 5.00x
this package assumes you have installed perl 5.00x

to compile:
	cd ..
	make perl
	cd perl
	make test

to make a stand alone binary:
	make perl

to install:
	make install [not tested :-)]

to read the man-page:
	perldoc Dbf.pm

to see a simple example:
	use Dbf;
	$db = Dbf->new("test.dbf");
	$db->open() || die;
	while (@rec = $db->next()) {
		print "@rec\n";
	}
	$db->close();
__EOF__
